# Welcome to **SpoCK** üöÄ
**SpoCK** is a [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) application designed to search public websites for 

`Sp`otting `C`linical `K`nowledge. 

It brings together two main steps to streamline your exploration:  

- **`scraping`**: Extract relevant text from public websites  
- **`ner`**: Use LLMs to identify *drug names* and *adverse drug reactions*

### Why SpoCK?  
Built with an `async` concurrency framework, SpoCK ensures efficient performance and simplifies horizontal scaling; this aims to address the handling of growing data and user demands.

**SpoCK** is aimed to be highliy customizable. Here are some ideas adapt it to your needs:  

- üîç **Add a database**: Store processed information for easy reference and analysis.  
- üë• **Enable login/user management**: Personalize user experiences.  
- üß† **Expand entity recognition**: Search for more or different named entities tailored to your needs.  
- üåê **Broaden your search**: Integrate additional or alternative data sources for even richer insights.  

Give **SpoCK** a try and see how it transforms clinical knowledge discovery into a breeze! üåü  


### Getting Started
#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- OpenAI API Key or Ollama Enpoint

A local Ollama inference container can be set up by:
```bash
docker run -d -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama
docker exec -it ollama ollama pull llama3.2
```

#### Python environment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-vianu/vianu.git
cd vianu
poetry install
poetry shell
```

#### Environment Variables
You can use an `.env` file for defining the following Envornment Variables:
- `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`: when using Ollama Endpoint
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: when using OpenAI Endpoint

or alternatively set the corresponding environment variable through the UI.

### Run demo pipeline
```bash
python vianu/spock/launch_demo_pipeline.py
```

### Run demo app
```bash
python vianu/spock/launch_demo_app.py
```

### CLI
```bash
python -m vianu.spock --term dafalgan --endpoint llama --data-path "/tmp/spock" --data-file "spock_data" --log-level DEBUG
```
